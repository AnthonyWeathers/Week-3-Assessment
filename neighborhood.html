    <h2> Neighborhood </h2>
    <p> I don't really live in a neighborhood, since first off, I live in an apartment complex. Secondly, most families living in this complex keep to themselves or a select few, while mostly having friends or family from elsewhere visit. Funny thing, there's another apartment complex across the street, then some houses but also buildings for offices or places for work are along the street the apartment is on. </p>

    <h2> Restaurants Nearby </h2>
    <p> Note: I never been to any of these restaurants, restaurants are not my thing normally unless someone wishes to go while I'm with them. I did a search of restaurants near me, so I apologize for not having any ones I like to offer </p>
