        <h2> My skills </h2>

        <p> Basic skills are that I always try to learn new things that interest me, I always am open to working or collaborating with others as long as they're open to teamwork as well. I have basic understanding of coding in C++, Python, and Javscript and progressing towards becoming a qualified Software Developer. Modifying and creating html webpages are just another skill I'm adding to my growing list. </p>

        <br>

        <h2> Interests </h2>

        <ul>
            <li> Gaming; Always been a gamer since I was a kid, I'll take any work seriously but on my off time, I very much enjoy games as a relaxation. </li>

            <br>

            <li> Coding; It's a tough thing to learn all of it and to be able to apply it, but its so satisfying when I get the code to work as it was expected function. </li>

            <br>

            <li> Reading; Mostly fanfiction stories nowadays, but quite enjoy most stories and seeing how the authors make a world, or how they interpret the information given by the world they're making their own story from. </li>

        <h2> Career Goals </h2>

        <p> I don't plan much ahead of time, mostly only for the next and maybe the step ahead of that, since I know the future can change circumstances at any point so I rather stay adaptable. Currently, just learning and studying to graduate from DevMountain as a professional Software Developer or one of their other graduate types should I choose to swap my curriculum. After graduation, getting a job would be my next career goal as my first thing is to get a job so I can continue learning and gain on the job experience. After that, hard to say, perhaps changing companies after a few years, progress up in the company, or anything, I don't know what I'd decide on by then, but I'll do my best to make my present and later steps easier by learning now. </p>
